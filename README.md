# Mnist-Digit-recognition
Digit Recognition Model built using the MNIST dataset and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained to classify handwritten digits (0–9) through supervised learning. Implemented data preprocessing, training, and evaluation to achieve strong accuracy. A beginner friendly deep learning project demonstrating core ANN concepts.
